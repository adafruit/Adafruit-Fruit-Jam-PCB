## Factory Reset file - Fruit Jam - Mini RP2350 Computer

This is the factory reset file for the Fruit Jam - Mini RP2350 Computer.

The *Adafruit_Fruit_Jam_Factory_Reset.uf2* file is a NeoPixel rainbow swirl for the five onboard NeoPixels.

The *Adafruit_Fruit_Jam_Full_Demo.uf2* file runs a full hardware test for all of the peripherals onboard the Fruit Jam. The Arduino sketch for that is available [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/main/Factory_Tests/Fruit_Jam_Factory_Test/Fruit_Jam_Factory_Test.ino).
